‘Niskie’  A Mental Health Web App Documentation

1. Introduction
In today’s fast-paced world, mental health awareness is growing, but resources and support systems are not always easily accessible. This project aims to develop a full-stack web application for mental health support. Built using React for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and PostgreSQL or SQLAlchemy for the database, the app is designed to connect users to personalized mental health resources, counseling services, and mental wellness tools, all within an intuitive and responsive interface.

2. Problem Statement
Many individuals experiencing mental health challenges find it difficult to seek help due to a lack of accessible resources, fear of judgment, or financial constraints. Traditional therapy sessions may be costly, and mental health resources are often dispersed and difficult to navigate. There are few competitors, however, their digital platforms are generalized with other health services or very expensive. There is a need for a digital solution that centralizes mental health resources and provides affordable, anonymous, and user-friendly access to mental wellness support.

3. Solution
The mental health web app will offer users access to self-assessment tools, educational content on mental health, and connections to professional counseling services. Users can explore resources based on their preferences and needs. The app will feature:
Anonymous user accounts to protect privacy.
Interactive self-assessment quizzes to identify areas of mental health concern.
Access to licensed counselors for virtual sessions.
Personalized mental wellness plans generated from quiz results.
Mental health blog articles and educational content.
A responsive design that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

4. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The MVP will focus on the following core features:
User registration and login (with social login options).
Anonymous user profile creation.
Mental health self-assessment quizzes.
Generation of personalized mental health plans based on quiz results.
Mental health resources, including blog posts and educational content.
Simple and intuitive UI with mobile responsiveness.


5. Strategies
To achieve the app's goals, the following strategies will be employed:
User-Centered Design: Regular feedback loops with potential users to ensure that the interface is intuitive, welcoming, and accessible.
Mobile-First Approach: Prioritizing mobile functionality and responsiveness during development, given the increasing usage of mobile devices for healthcare services.
Security: Ensuring user data is encrypted and stored securely, and authentication is protected using industry-standard practices (JWT and OAuth).
Scalable Architecture: Structuring the app to be easily scalable by utilizing microservices architecture and cloud solutions to handle increasing traffic.


6. Algorithms
The following algorithms will be central to the functionality:
Recommendation Algorithm: A personalized recommendation engine to suggest mental health resources, articles, or connections to licensed counselors based on user assessments and history.
Quiz Logic: The mental health quiz will use a weighted scoring algorithm to assess the user’s mental health and provide tailored results.
Matching Algorithm: For users looking for professional counseling, a matching algorithm will pair them with the most suitable counselor based on preferences, mental health needs, and availability.

7. User Interface (UI)
The UI will be developed using React with a focus on simplicity and accessibility. Key features include:
Intuitive Dashboard: Users will have access to mental health assessments, personalized content, and counseling options.
Progressive Disclosure: Information will be presented gradually to prevent overwhelming the user, allowing them to navigate mental health content at their own pace.
Responsive Design: The app will feature a mobile-first design, ensuring seamless usability on various screen sizes, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
Accessibility Features: The app will adhere to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) to ensure it is usable for individuals with disabilities.



8. Test Coverage
A robust testing strategy will be in place to ensure reliability and functionality across various devices:
Unit Testing: Each component, both in the frontend and backend, will be unit tested to ensure individual functionality.
Integration Testing: End-to-end tests will simulate real user interactions, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend, backend, and database.
Mobile Testing: Extensive testing will be performed on mobile browsers and devices to ensure a smooth user experience.
Automated Testing Pipelines: A CI/CD pipeline will automate tests upon each deployment, ensuring high code quality.



9. Technology Stack
The tech stack for this app will be:
Frontend: React, Redux (for state management), and Bootstrap/Material-UI for a modern, responsive UI.
Backend: Flask for handling API requests, routing, and business logic.
Database: PostgreSQL or SQLAlchemy to store user data, quiz results, and mental health resources.
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication, with OAuth support for social logins.
Deployment: Docker for containerization, deployed on cloud services like AWS or Heroku for scalability.
Mobile Compatibility: Responsive design powered by CSS Flexbox and Grid, tested across multiple screen sizes and platforms.
